![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/slothings/work-day-scheduler)

Work Day Scheduler is a repository where I used a CSS, HTML, Javascript (jQuery), and a third-party API (moment.js) to create a planner for your 9AM-5PM activities.

Moment.js was used and can be found [here](https://momentjs.com/)
